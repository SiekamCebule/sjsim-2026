# @sjsim/infra

Infrastructure adapters for Sj.Sim Predazzo 2026.

This package will host implementations of persistence and other infrastructure. A minimal `buildInfrastructure` placeholder is present; concrete interfaces and adapters will be added per REQUIREMENTS.md.

Planned modules:

- SQLite persistence (offline career save files).
- Mock adapters for automated testing.
- Future integrations (analytics, leaderboards).
